Installation: It is highly recommended that you use the command-line utility found at https://github.com/AI-Planning/api-tools to install (i.e., clone) this repository. Not only will it fetch the latest and update the repository if you wish, but it will point the local API to the correct directory for the domains.

NOTE :
The directory "classical_fixed" contains fixes to PDDL syntax for compatibility with Tarski parser
